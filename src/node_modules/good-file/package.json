  "readme": "# good-file\n\nFile logging module for [good](https://github.com/hapijs/good) process monitoring.\n\n![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hapijs/good-file.svg?branch=master) ![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/good-file.svg)\n\nLead Maintainer: [Adam Bretz](https://github.com/arb)\n\n## Usage\n\n`good-file` is a [good-reporter](https://github.com/hapijs/good-reporter) implementation to write hapi server events to log files.\n\n## Good File\n### new GoodFile (config, events)\n\ncreates a new GoodFile object with the following arguments\n- `config` - specifications for the file that will be used. All file operations are done in \"append\" mode.\n\t- `String` - a string that indicates the log file to use. Opened in \"append\" mode.\n\t- `Object` - a configuration object for automatically generated files. Auto generated files use the following pattern for file naming: \"{`options.prefix`}-{utcTime.format(`options.format`)}-{random string}.{`settings.extension`}\"\n\t \t- `path` - required. Path to the directory to store log files.\n\t \t- `[format]` - a [MomentJs](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) format string. Defaults to \"YYYY-MM-DD\".\n\t \t- `[extension]` - file extension to use when creating a file. Defaults to \".log\". Set to \"\" for no extension.\n\t \t- `[prefix]` - file name prefix to use when creating a file. Defaults to \"good-file\"\n\t \t- `[rotate]` - a string indicating a log rotation time span. The designated time span will start a timer that will trigger at the *end* of the specified time span. For example, using \"daily\", a new log file would be created at *approximately* 11:59:59.999 on the current day. Please see [this section](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/end-of/) in the Moment.js documentation for more details. The string must be one of the following values: ['hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'].\n\t\t> **Limitations** A new file is *always* created when the process starts, regardless of `rotate` option; this is to prevent collisions. So if you start and stop the process several times in a row, there will be a new file created each time and a new timer will start at the beginning of the process. There is also a maximum \"wait time\" good-file can allow. If your time string exceeds this number, it will be replaced with `2^31 - 1` milliseconds (about 25 days). This is a limitation in how JavaScript/[Node implements](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/timers.js#L29) timers. There are also several time related precision issues when working with JavaScript. The log rotation will happen \"close enough\" to the desired `rotate` option.\n- `events` - an object of key value pairs.\n\t- `key` - one of the supported [good events](https://github.com/hapijs/good) indicating the hapi event to subscribe to\n\t- `value` - a single string or an array of strings to filter incoming events. \"\\*\" indicates no filtering. `null` and `undefined` are assumed to be \"\\*\"\n\n\n### GoodFile Methods\n`good-file` implements the [good-reporter](https://github.com/hapijs/good-reporter) interface as has no additional public methods.\n",
